    <p>
        My favorite restaurant is an erode restaurant called <mark> “ERODE AMMAN MESS”</mark>. The best meal it serves
        is delicious and wonderful pizza.
        I like the way they prepare this pizza more than many other restaurants. I find it a nice way they cut the
        ingredients, I always find it thin and it is always fresh and of excellent quality.

        The degree of cooking is great, always moderate and not too much. So I love it so much and I love eating it in
        this place so much. I can’t get rid of the wonderful smell that I can smell while it’s still on its way to me.


        I certainly have that childish expression on my face because I long to take a piece of it and leave it a little
        in my mouth. I can never hide this expression no matter who I take with me to my favorite restaurant.

        Of course, what makes me more determined for this restaurant is the experiences of others around me, friends and
        family, all of whom praise the wonderful taste of this restaurant.

        I feel like I’m going there very soon, because this talk made me want to eat some pizza. I might go today, I
        don’t know if I could, but if I did, it would be very nice.

        I also hope that everyone will be fortunate to find a favorite restaurant that he would like to return to with
        great anticipation.
